This application uses Spring Data JPA to store and retrieve data in a relational database.

== What It Does

The application stores `Customer` POJOs in a memory-based database.

Spring Data JPAs most compelling feature is the ability to create repository implementations
automatically, at runtime, from a repository interface.

== Running the Application

When you run your application, you should see output similar to the following:

====
----
== Customers found with findAll():
---------------------------------
Customer[id=1, firstName='Mahanta']
Customer[id=2, firstName='Samnateyu']
Customer[id=3, firstName='Dhritimitra']
Customer[id=4, firstName='Somakirti']

Customers found with findByFirstName("name"):
--------------------------------------------
Customer[id=3, firstName='Dhritimitra']

Customer found with findById(4):
-------------------------------
Customer[id=4, firstName='Somakirti']
